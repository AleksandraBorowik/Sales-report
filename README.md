# PowerBI Sales-report

I created this report using sample data provided by PowerBI Desktop. The report analyses the sales of products for company XYZ from September 2013 to the end of 2024. The aim of the analysis was to identify sales trends. In the report, I used my Power Query skills to create some DAX measures. The backgrounds were created in Power Point.

The report is four pages long. The first is a landing page with links to the other pages described below. Each of the pages has a navigation bar that allows you to navigate between them.

Sales: Provides an overall summary of sales (total gross sales, profit, number of units sold).
Product: Contains charts analysing metrics such as average selling price, average COGS (cost of goods sold), average profit and average discount broken down by specific products.
Sales Map: Presents analyses relating to sales in different countries.
